# [Mastermind](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)
In this project you’ll use Ruby to build an implementation of the classic game Mastermind.

## Introduction

### Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

- Apply principles of flow control across multiple methods
- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Learn to implement a REPL interface
- Apply Enumerable techniques in a real context

## Base Expectations

You are to build a playable game of Mastermind that runs in a REPL interface.

### Starting a Game
The player starts the game by running ruby mastermind.rb
Then they see:
```
Welcome to MASTERMIND

Would you like to (p)lay, read the (i)nstructions, or (q)uit?
>
```
- If they enter p or play then they enter the game flow described below.
- If they enter i or instructions they should be presented with a short explanation of how the game is played.
- If they enter q or quit then the game should exit
### Game Flow
Once the user starts a game they should see:
```
I have generated a beginner sequence with four elements made up of: (r)ed,
(g)reen, (b)lue, and (y)ellow. Use (q)uit at any time to end the game.
What's your guess?
```
They can then enter a guess in the form rrgb

- Guesses are case insensitive
- If it’s 'q' or 'quit' then exit the game
- If it’s 'c' or 'cheat' then print out the current secret code
- If it’s fewer than four letters, tell them it’s too short
- If it’s longer than four letters, tell them it’s too long
- If they guess the secret sequence, enter the end game flow below
- Otherwise give them feedback on the guess like this:
```
'RRGB' has 3 of the correct elements with 2 in the correct positions
You've taken 1 guess
```
Then let them guess again, repeating the game flow loop.

### End Game
When the user correctly guesses the sequence, output the following:
```
Congratulations! You guessed the sequence 'GRRB' in 8 guesses over 4 minutes,
22 seconds.

Do you want to (p)lay again or (q)uit?
```
If they enter 'p' or 'play' then restart the game. 'q' or 'quit' ends the game.

## Extensions
If you’re able to finish the base expectations, add on one or more of the following extensions:

### Difficulty Levels
When the user is getting ready to start a game, ask them what difficulty level they’d like to play with the following adaptations:

- Beginner = 4 characters, 4 colors
- Intermediate = 6 characters, 5 colors
- Advanced = 8 characters, 6 colors

### Record Tracking & Top 10
Use a file on the file system (like CSV, JSON, etc) to track completed games across runs of the program. When the user wins the game, output a message like this:
```
Congratulations! You've guessed the sequence! What's your name?

> Jeff

Jeff, you guessed the sequence 'GRRB' in 8 guesses over 4 minutes,
22 seconds. That's 1 minute, 10 seconds faster and two guesses fewer than the
average.

=== TOP 10 ===
1. Jeff solved 'GRRB' in 8 guesses over 4m22s
2. Jeff solved 'BRGG' in 11 guesses over 4m45s
3. Jorge solved 'BBBB' in 12 guesses over 4m15s
4. Jorge solved 'GGBB' in 12 guesses over 5m12s
```

Note that they’re ranked first by number of guesses then by time.

## Package & Polish
Your game won’t be very popular if it’s hard to install and run.

### Add a Command Line Wrapper
Create an executable script that allows the user to just run mastermind from their terminal without directly executing Ruby.

### Other Ideas
- Add a history instruction to the gameplay which can be called before entering a guess and it’ll display all previous guesses and results in a compact form
- Visual Interface - add colors and ASCII graphics to make a more compelling visual experience
- Two-Player Mode - Add a game mode where players alternate guesses and whoever gets the sequence right first wins. Consider having their guesses hidden.

## Evaluation Rubric
The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

- 4: Above expectations
- 3: Meets expectations
- 2: Below expectations
- 1: Well-below expectations

### Expectations:

## 1. Ruby Syntax & Style
- Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation
- Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- Ruby methods used are logical and readable
- Code is indented properly
- Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories
## 2. Breaking Logic into Components
- Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
- No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP
## 3. Test-Driven Development
- Each method is tested
- Tests implement Ruby syntax & style
## 4. Functionality
- Application meets all requirements
## 5. Git Workflow
- Project has at least 20 commits and uses Pull Request workflow.
